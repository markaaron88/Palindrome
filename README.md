# Palindrome
 Write a C++ program “palindrome.cpp” that reads a string of characters from user and determines if the string is a palindrome or not.  For the program, you should store each character of the string in an array (use dynamic memory to create array(s)) and follow the algorithm described in the lecture. 
Palindrome is a string that reads the same from both the beginning and the end. Here are sample test cases:
(1) Input string 1: racecar                        
	Output: Yes, it’s a palindrome
(2) Input string 2: abcdefghijihgfedcba    
	Output: Yes, it’s a palindrome 
(3) Input string 3: CSUMB                       
	Output: No, it’s not a palindrome
